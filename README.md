The proposed online game consists on a 2D 1 vs 1 shooter where two spaceships fight one another. Currently the UDP server and client conexion is functional and the spaceships move freely on the scene, the client spaceship has it's shooting system implemented and rotation towards the point of the users mouse. 
The game currently has a bug where the server in the client and server don't match completely as the server doesn't show the bullets if you hold the left click instead of using multiple clicks.
