This is our 1 vs 1 multiplayer spaceship game where a red and a green spaceship face off in a shooting game where they have to take out three lives from each other, while avoiding the falling asteroids. 

How does it work: 
Open three instances of the .exe and start with clicking the "start as" at the bottom right of the menu to open the server, then click play on the two other instances to test the game.

Controls: 
    - w,a,s,d to move 
    - left click to shoot at the mouse position

For this final delivery we made upgrades to the UI of the game for a better visual experience, we added replayability and the hability to easily restart matches and added Networking functionalities shown in class.
